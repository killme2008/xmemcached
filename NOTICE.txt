*******************************************


2009-09-17

--------xmemcached 1.2.0-RC2-Released----------
1.Add KestrelCommandFactory for using xmemcached to talk with kestrel(a MQ written in scala).
Kestrel(http://github.com/robey/kestrel) use memcached text protocol,but not all compatible.

2.Implement a election hash session locator.
Election hash just like consistent hash,more infomation see (http://devcentral.f5.com/Default.aspx?
tabid=63&articleType=ArticleView&ArticleID=135&PageID=151)

3.Extend Transcoder interface,add some new methods to configure it.

public void setPackZeros(boolean packZeros);
public void setPrimitiveAsString(boolean primitiveAsString);

"setPrimitiveAsString" This method is used to set whether to store primitive type as string in memcached.
"setPackZeros" This method is used to set whether to remove all zero bytes from the MSB of the packed num


4.Bug fixed since 1.2.0-RC1.

2009-09-08
--------xmemcached 1.2.0-RC1-Released-----------

1.Supports all binary protcol of memcached.Add BinaryCommandFactory class to support it.if you want to use
that,just add one line code:

memcachedClientbuilder.setCommandFactory(new BinaryCommandFactory());

2.Supports hibernate-memcached,about the detail please see wiki page
http://code.google.com/p/xmemcached/wiki/Hibernate_memcached_integration

3.Compatible with jdk5.

4.Move from common-logging to slf4j.

5.Implement connection pool.Allow to create more connection to one memcached server.Default pool size is one,you can change it like this:
   memcachedClient.setConnectionPoolSize(2);
Then,xmemcached will create two connections to one memcached server.Your application must ensure updating data is synchronized between connections.

6.Upgrade yanf4j to 1.0-SNAPSHOT.This version is introduce SocketOption class to configure tcp options easily,and refactoring for implement aio(jdk7 nio2.0).

7.Remove ant build script,simplify maven build.

8.BUG fixed since 1.1.3 and 1.2.0-beta


--------------------------------------------




2009-07-13
--------xmemcached 1.1.3-Released-----------
1.Upgrade yanf4j to 0.7.0, yanf4j-0.7.0 is a refactoring version and turned for best performance.

2.Disable tcp nagle algorithm by default,change default tcp receive buffer size from 16k to 8k.
3.Add a new interface MemcachedClientStateListener for listenning xmemcached client's events to callback.MemcachedClient add two methods:

public void addStateListener(MemcachedClientStateListener listener);
public void removeStateListener(MemcachedClientStateListener listener);
public Collection<MemcachedClientStateListener> getStateListeners();

4.Make a new benchmark,please see
http://xmemcached.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/benchmark/benchmark.html

5.Refactoring and bug fixed.Issue 39 etc.


--------------------------------------------
2009-06-22
--------xmemcached 1.1.2-Released-----------
1.Supports integrating to spring framework.for example:

 <bean name="memcachedClient"
        class="net.rubyeye.xmemcached.utils.XMemcachedClientFactoryBean">
        <property name="servers">
            <value>localhost:12000 localhost:12001</value>
        </property>
 </bean>
Then you can use memcachedClient bean in other beans.More information is on wiki.

2.Support verbosity protocol.This protocol is used to set logging level for memcached logging output.
Add two methods to MemcachedClient,include:

setLoggingLevelVerbosity(InetSocketAddress address, int level)
setLoggingLevelVerbosityWithNoReply(InetSocketAddress address,int level)

3.Support weighted server.Now you can set the memcached servers in different weight.
The only change is the way to build XMemcachedClient:


MemcachedClientBuilder builder = new XMemcachedClientBuilder(AddrUtil.getAddresses("localhost:12000 localhost:12001"),new int[]{1,3});
builder.setSessionLocator(new KetamaMemcachedSessionLocator());
MemcachedClient memcachedClient=builder.build();

As you see,now you can pass a weight array to XMemcachedClientBuilder constructor.The array's length must be great or equal to address list size.

4.Support noreply for add,set,replace,cas,append,prepend,delete,incr/decr,flush_all,verbosity protocols.
Add some new methods in MemcachedClient,include:

setWithNoReply,addWithNoReply,replaceWithNoReply,appendWithNoReply,prependWithNoReply,casWithNoReply
deleteWithNoReply,incr(decr)WithNoReply,flushAllWithNoReply,setLoggingLevelVerbosityWithNoReply

5.Bug fixed. Issue 35,Issue 36,Issue 37,Issue 38 etc.

6.Improve session monitor.When session is closed by exception or network error,
monitor will reconnect to the session until success.
The older version set the interval between reconnecting is 10 seconds,now set it to 0 seconds.

7.Improve JMX supports.Add a new method to XMemcachedClientMBean:
     /**
     * Set a memcached server's weight
     *
     * @param server
     * @param weight
     */
    public void setServerWeight(String server, int weight);

Change the getServersDescription method's result,add weight to description.
